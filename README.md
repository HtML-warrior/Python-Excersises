Click the code button and download zip file. If you have VS code you can run the code in the terminal (right click and run code in terminal) if not you can put the code in your dedicated browser to copy and paste it in any code reader (replit, python interpreter, w3, etc...). if you cant download the program to use i have examples on how it looks in the file to get a good idea of how it works
